# command-finder.py

This one's pretty barebones. It was the first one I made, and it was only meant
to be functional, not necessarily nice to use. You actually have to edit the
source to change the output type. Maybe it's due for a rewrite, but I think
making the newer ones is a bit more urgent.

This is made for CPython 3.5.2, but it should probably work on any version of
Python 3. It only depends on the Python standard library.
