# CommandFinder(s)

This is a set of programs written in a few different language that all do pretty
much the same thing. Some time in October 2015 someone made a thread on a forum
for a game I used to play asking for a solution to a problem they were having.
My solution was to loop through all of their add-ons, and pick out everything
that looks like the creation of a chat command.

I wrote that in Python. Then, soon after, I'd wind up learning Java, and I
figured, what better way to flex my new muscles than to implement this again,
but in a different language? So I did it. And so began a tradition to make this
part of every new language I learn. I figured it was about time to get them all
in one place.

The purpose of this is two things. Most importantly, it gives me much-needed
practice with a language I've just learned. Second, it also gives me something
to show others that I know these languages, and that I am able to write a
functioning program in them. And that I know how to use git, I guess.


## To Do

 - Python ✓ - Done long ago.
 - Java ✓ - Done slightly less long ago.
 - JavaScript - Next in line. I've actually known JS for quite some time, but I
   just haven't bothered to do this in it yet.
 - C# - I've already gotten moderately comfortable with C#, but I haven't quite
   gotten to this point with it yet. Soon, though.
 - C - I kind of know C. I haven't touched it in a while, but a little less than
   two years ago I would've told you I was familiar with it. Probably coming up
   after C#.
 - Lua - A language I know, but haven't had much practice in, like C.
 - Rust - Just interested.
 - Go - Again, interested. Particularly so, in fact.
 - Swift? - Seems interesting, but I don't have a Mac, and I don't use Linux
   full-time, so its usefulness may be limited for now.
 - ???

I suppose this could also be used as a way for me to keep up with the languages
I know or want to know. So you can see that there, too. I guess you'll just have
to take my word for it, when it comes to those I haven't written this in, until
I do so.
