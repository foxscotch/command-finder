# CommandFinder(s)

This is a set of programs written in a few different language that all do pretty
much the same thing. Some time in October 2015 someone made a thread on a forum
for a game I used to play asking for a solution to a problem they were having.
My solution was to loop through all of their add-ons, and pick out everything
that looks like the creation of a chat command.

I wrote that in Python. Then, soon after, I'd wind up learning Java, and I
figured, what better way to flex my new muscles than to implement this again,
but in a different language? So I did it. And so began a tradition to make this
part of every new language I learn. I figured it was about time to get them all
in one place.


## To Do

 - Python ✓ - Done long ago.
 - Java ✓ - Done slightly less long ago.
 - JavaScript - Next in line. I've actually known JS for quite some time, but I
   just haven't bothered to do this in it yet.
 - C# - I've already gotten moderately comfortable with C#, but I haven't quite
   gotten to this point with it yet. Soon, though.
 - C - I kind of know C. I haven't touched it in a while, but a little less than
   two years ago I would've told you I was familiar with it. Probably coming up
   after C#.
